# Python hard rules

Every agent in this sequence enforces this exact block locally; it is non-negotiable and must never be softened.

## Python hard rules

- Generate Python only unless the prompt explicitly asks for another language. Do not emit TypeScript, JavaScript, or other-language source or tooling for a Python task.
- Return exactly one JSON object. Never print prose, logs, or Markdown outside that single JSON result.
- Never invent missing upstream contracts. When a required artifact is absent, return `status: "needs_input"` and name the missing contract in `diagnostics` instead of guessing.
- No mutable or runtime-created default arguments: never `=[]`, `={}`, `=set()`, `=dict()`, `=list()`, `=defaultdict(...)`, `=Path(...)`, `=datetime.now()`, or an object instance in a signature. Use `None` plus in-body initialization, or `dataclasses.field(default_factory=...)`.
- No mutable class attributes unless explicitly approved as an immutable constant or safe shared state.
- No import-time side effects: module top level holds only imports, constants, type aliases, and class/function/dataclass definitions — never service/client/repository/session/network/file/app/worker construction or work.
- No hidden dependency lookup: no service locator, ambient global container, dynamic registry, `globals()`/`getattr` resolution, monkeypatch-dependent design, or implicit singleton. Dependencies are explicit constructor parameters, function parameters, provider outputs, or test fixtures.
- Resource-owning code must use `with`, `contextlib`, `try/finally`, or an explicit close/cleanup strategy so resources are released even on error.
- Library, domain, and application code must not `print` or read stdin for control flow; use return values, exceptions, or logging. Interface/CLI modules own user I/O.
- No bare `except`, no `except Exception: pass`, no silently swallowed errors. Catch narrow exceptions, only when the contract requires it, and raise specific exceptions.
- No `eval`, unsafe `exec`, unsafe `pickle` loads, or shell-string command construction unless the contract explicitly requires and guards it.
- Public functions and methods carry explicit type hints on parameters and return types; use `Optional[T]`/`T | None` only when the target Python version supports the syntax.
- Domain/core must not import infrastructure, interface, CLI, framework, test, or composition modules; application code depends on domain and ports/protocols only.
- Tests must be deterministic and isolated: no real network, real clock, randomness, external filesystem state, or environment dependence unless injected or isolated; prove seams with fakes, stubs, or in-memory adapters.
- Validation cannot pass unless required static checks and tests actually ran, or are honestly reported as `not_run` with repair/execution tasks. Every package ships runnable metadata (normally `pyproject.toml`) plus tests.
- Manage the project environment and dependencies with `uv` by default (or an explicit isolated virtual environment) — never install into or depend on the system/global interpreter (no bare `pip install` outside a venv, no `--break-system-packages`). Declare dependencies in `pyproject.toml` with dev/test/lint tools under PEP 735 `[dependency-groups]`, pin the interpreter (`.python-version`), commit and never hand-edit the lockfile (`uv.lock`) for applications, and run tools through that environment (`uv run …` or `python -m …`). A stdlib-only single-file script needs no project environment.
- Keep the working tree clean: touch only the files your task approves, never clobber or partially overwrite an existing file you did not author (`README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `.gitignore`), and leave behind no stray scratch files, debug/heredoc output, or generated artifacts (`__pycache__/`, `.venv/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, `*.egg-info/`, `build/`, `dist/`) — caches and build output belong in `.gitignore`. When you finish, only the intended deliverables are changed; revert anything accidental.
